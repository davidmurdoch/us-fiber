U.S. Fiber Initiative

U.S. Internet is painfully slow and obsolete. This repository is aimed at looking into changing this. Please submit

Ookla put U.S. download speeds at 28th worldwide.

Nuro Internet service in Tokyo, Japan (and surrounding prefectures) offers 2Gbps down with 1Gbps up home Internet 
for about $51 USD/month, with nearly 25% of homes connected.

We are so far behind it is embarrassing â€” frightening, even.

Can *we* fix this ourselves?

I'm not sure. Goldman Sachs has estimated that it would cost Google about $140 billion (or more) to roll 
Google Fiber out to the rest of the United States. That's a lot of money.

But maybe not too much...

At $140 billion, that comes out to only $1,400 per U.S. household (only considering those households that are already 
paying for broadband Internet: or about 100 million households). With average monthly broadband Internet fees of 
$45/month, that $1,400 is 2.5 years worth of Internet access. And this doesn't include commercial potential. Put in 
these terms, it seems almost feasable.


Where do we start?
-----

0: Figure out just how much money we need.  
1: Put together a business plan.  
2: Raise money: Ask friends, colleagues, corporations, ~~governments~~, Elon Musk (and friends), for money. Note: Kickstarter maxes out at $100M.   
3: Build it (and while we're at it, make it open source)   
5: Profit


How can you help?
-----

Research, gather statistics, find out how much money this will require.

Tell people.

Improve this respository.
